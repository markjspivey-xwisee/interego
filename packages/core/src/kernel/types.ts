/**
 * @module kernel/types
 * @description Type surface for the Interego categorical kernel.
 *
 * The kernel exposes the substrate's primitives as first-class verbs.
 * The categorical foundations are spelled out in
 * `docs/ARCHITECTURAL-FOUNDATIONS.md`:
 *
 * | Kernel verb        | Categorical role                                |
 * |--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
 * | `mint`             | Identity-by-reference (Invariant 1)             |
 * | `dereference`      | Peircean Secondness — brute act of resolution   |
 * | `compose`          | Operadic composition over typed-hyperedge       |
 * |                    | category (the four operators form a lattice)    |
 * | `act`              | Peircean Thirdness made operational             |
 * | `restrict`/`extend`| Restriction/extension adjunction (Invariant 3)  |
 * | `promote`/`decompose` | PGSL fibration vertical movement             |
 *
 * The types in this module describe the kernel's wire surface only. They
 * compose the existing protocol types — `ContextDescriptorData`,
 * `ManifestEntry`, the PGSL Atom/Fragment shapes — without redefining
 * them. The kernel is a categorical SURFACE over the substrate, not a
 * parallel data model.

// ── Verb 9 — reduce (fold over a iep:supersedes chain) ────────
//
// `reduce(chainHeadIri, reducerSpec?)` walks the iep:supersedes back-
// links from the head to the oldest link, folds the chain through a
// declarative reducer (NOT arbitrary code), and returns a canonical
// "current state" alongside a ReplayProof a third party can use to
// independently verify the fold. The reducer is itself content-
// addressed; a verifier re-fetches chain + reducer by CID and replays.
//
// Categorical role: the fold is the colimit of the chain in the
// supersession category — a left-Kan extension along the inclusion
// of the chain into the descriptor category. The reducer is the
// algebra; checkpoints are the standard "every k-th cocone" trick that
// localizes mismatches without re-replaying from scratch.

/**
 * Declarative reducer specification. Two substrate-honest kinds:
 *
 *   - `'turtle-template'` — a Turtle document with `{?prior.iep:value}`
 *     / `{?current.iep:value}` placeholders. The kernel binds them and
 *     materializes triples. Pure data; no execution.
 *
 *   - `'shacl-transform'` — a SHACL graph using `sh:rule` /
 *     `sh:construct` / `sh:targetClass`. The fold runs each link
 *     through the SHACL engine; the rule's constructed triples become
 *     the next state. Pure shape transformation.

 * by any independent verifier with the same SHACL engine or Turtle
